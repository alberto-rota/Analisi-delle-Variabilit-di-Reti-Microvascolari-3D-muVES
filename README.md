## Abstract
The recent development of the Organ-on-Chip technology and, in particular microfluidic devices, has revealed the need for methods providing accurate and quick results, for both morphological and topological analyses.
The aim of this work is to develop a computational analysis method applicable to 3D microvascular networks of any size, resolution and morphology, which also calculates the significant quantitative parameters. The three-dimensional volume obtained from confocal microscopy is used as a starting point for the segmentation and then for the skeletonization of the network, which provides a good topological representation of the vasculature. From these bases is possible to obtain morphological parameters, including the radius, length and tortuosity of each branch with their network-related distributions as a whole. This algorithm also allows to interface the analyzed vessel structure with a software for the fluid-dynamic study of the network.
The computational method developed is universally applicable and is versatile on performance: by setting appropriate parameters is possible to perform an analysis that favors the accuracy of the results or the time required for the computer.
